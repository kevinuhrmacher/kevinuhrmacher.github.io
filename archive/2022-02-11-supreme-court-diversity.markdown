When Justice Stephen Breyer announced he would retire from the Supreme Court, attention quickly turned to President Biden’s promise to fill the seat with a Black woman jurist. I thought the iconic photo of mostly White and male Supreme Court justices, year over year, could drive home the historic nature of Biden’s choice. Amber Phillips contributed the insight that gave the visuals consequence: Pairing them with instances when diversity on the court made a difference. We [published quickly][project-link] by making strategic choices to limit the photo assets we needed to obtain and took potential obstacles like shifted work schedules and used them to our advantage, setting intermittent deadlines to allow all to get their work done. Madison Walls and Thomas Simonetti were key collaborators in the effort.

I identified an opportunity while working a weekend shift to quickly respond to the protests of George Floyd’s killing taking place in downtown D.C. When activists began using a barrier fence as a canvas for their protest signs, it was [a poignant visual snapshot][project-link] of the frustration and fear in the crowds. I laid out a vision for a horizontal scrolling experience along a panoramic photo of the wall and worked with Monica Ulmanu to define how each person would contribute. We mobilized quickly — the fencing was slated to come down within days — Gabriel Florit captured the scene, Joe Fox built the page and Bonnie Berkowitz and I reported the annotations. The piece was technically challenging and captured the scene just before the fence was removed.

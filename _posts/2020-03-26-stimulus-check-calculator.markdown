I was involved in the inception, reporting, design and coordination for [this calculator][project-link], which allowed readers to check how much money they should expect from the government coronavirus stimulus bill. After the bill passed and payments were delivered, readers used the tool to fact-check their amounts. Many found they had been underpaid. We solicited feedback from users and coordinated with business reporter Heather Long, who used the stories to inform her reporting on hiccups in the IRS system that were causing incorrect payment amounts.

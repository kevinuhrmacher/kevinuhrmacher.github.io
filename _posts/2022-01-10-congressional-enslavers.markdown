I served as a graphics editor and project manager on [this months-long data project][project-link] counting the U.S. lawmakers who enslaved humans. In addition to the main story, we published [a callout][callout-link] for readers to help identify other lawmakers. [The data was open-sourced on Github.][github-link]

My involvement began when reporter Julie Zauzmer reached out asking for data listing every person who had ever been in Congress. I pointed her toward a csv she could use to begin her mammoth reporting effort. When the time came to discuss what she was finding, I jumped at the chance to edit the project from Graphics. Working with Adrian Blanco Ramos and Leo Dominguez, I helped guide the team to think about visuals that would best tell this important story.

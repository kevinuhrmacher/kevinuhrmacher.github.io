I jumped at the chance to report from the Iowa State Fair to take the pulse of potential caucusgoers with a Democratic field of more than 20 candidates. There was much preparation to do beforehand, including designing a visual way to capture fairgoersâ€™ opinions, connecting with the audio team to plan out how we could capture the best audio of our conversations and photo for help setting the scene. Three days and one sunburn later, I brought back hours of interviews and dozens of diagrams that we overlaid and weaved into a story in collaboration with a stellar photo edit. In the end, [the project captured the contours of a race][project-link] with many players and helped show how voters were feeling in an engaging way.

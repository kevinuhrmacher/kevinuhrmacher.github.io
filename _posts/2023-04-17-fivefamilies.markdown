When Republican lawmakers started referring to their governing structure in a reference to The Godfather’s five families, we identified the possibility of breaking down those groups and explaining the key players in each faction. The project was a collaboration with The Post’s Congress team. We open-sourced the data as the membership of some of these groups was not well-known before we did this project.

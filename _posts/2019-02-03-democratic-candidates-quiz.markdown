The Democratic presidential field was shaping up to be one of the biggest ever at the beginning of 2019. Kevin Schaul and I decided we could help readers draw distinctions between the many candidates running, with a focus on substantive differences in their policy views. In addition to the big-picture proposal of this project, I led the reporting effort on [each of the nine surveys.}[survey-link] First, I crafted a set of questions — often in collaboration with reporters elsewhere in the newsroom. Then, I reached out to each campaign and categorized their responses. Rounds of communication with the campaigns helped ensure the accuracy of my characterizations. [This quiz][project-link] was the culmination of that reporting for more than 85 policy questions from health care to criminal justice reform. It converted hundreds of subscribers and was recognized with a Publisher’s Award.

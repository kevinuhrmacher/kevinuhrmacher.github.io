At the height of “Barbenheimer” mania, I shopped an idea for a visual story based on a TikTok I had seen. The premise: Oppenheimer was filmed in a very specific way, but the world’s theaters were not equipped for the epic aspect ratio — leading to what some were calling “Croppenheimer” at most theaters. When reporters on the team were busy or not interested, Tim Meko and I decided to do it ourselves. It raked in more than 750K pageviews as people searched how to get the movie the way Christopher Nolan intended it.

Ahead of the midterm elections, we prepared two live results pages that tracked in real-time how election deniers and abortion rights were doing on the ballot. The abortion-related issue page also contained an innovative feed of reporter insights that has informed The Postâ€™s efforts more broadly in live update situations. Readers loved being able to hear directly from our experts.

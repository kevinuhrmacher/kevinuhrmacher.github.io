A long-term goal that we realized in 2023 was getting Graphics reporters on the Hill to chronicle a consequential vote on a live page. This “scoreboard” of sorts was a must-watch during the vote, providing more detailed information than C-Span quickly and accurately.

To chronicle House votes in near real time, four Post reporters were at the Capitol recording the stance of each representative as shown on screens in the U.S. House chamber. We spent a month getting familiar with the press gallery staff and I set up practice vote simulations, including some changes midway through, to rehearse for the big day. Reporters also consulted the official roll call provided a short time after the vote by the House clerk.

This was the culmination of many efforts to count votes in Congress. Those pages have been well-received by readers and we’re currently working on automating and that work so we can more efficiently cover more votes. The pages have generated millions of views and dozens of new subscribers.

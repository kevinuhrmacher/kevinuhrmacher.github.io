Ahead of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, I proposed a tracker of state abortion laws that would answer the question I assumed most would have if Roe v. Wade was struck down: Which states will ban abortion next? The collaborative effort paired Graphics reporters with Caroline Kitchener, our expert on this line of coverage. It would become a part of The Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning entry for National Reporting in 2023.

We also prepared [a callout for readers to answer in the aftermath of the decision][project-link-2] that drew the most responses for any callout The Post had ever done.
